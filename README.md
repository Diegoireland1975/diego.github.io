# Portgolio Website

## Overview

This is My Portfolio Website with 9 Projects inside at the moment.

## Description

For my Portfolio i wanted to create a really simple and clean layout.
I think most of the time simplicity it's better.
The main problem for me was to make the cards flipping. At the beginning just one was working. I solved with a for each loop.
Also to make the two faces cards was a bit challenging. I had to do a lot of Google Research. As my teacher used to say:" If you don't know something Google it!
The main photo it's mine I took it at the Dublin Docs by Night.
For the typewriter I had to follow a tutorial many times, because I still have to improve my JS.
Anyway The idea to implement a cursor was mine.
I inserted it with a pseudo element and make it blink with a simple animation of the opacity.
Also I applied a delay of 1 sec to make the cursor blinking, only after the typewriting is stopping
